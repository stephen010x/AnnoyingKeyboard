# -- Welcome to AnnoyingKeyboard.exe! --

The AnnoyingKeyboard.exe enhances your
typing experience by increasing your
number of typos by over 240 percent!

**This program includes a random chance to:**
1) Randomly swap two letters!
2) Replacing a letter with a nearby
   one on the keyboard!
3) Outright ignoring your keypress!

I hope you enjoy!
